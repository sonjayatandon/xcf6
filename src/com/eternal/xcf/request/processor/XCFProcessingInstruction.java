/**
 * This is the interface implemented by classes used to process requests.  There several type of processing instructions.
 * The most common types are:
 *   Commands (implemented by INSTRUCTION_Command) -- these objects are the primary handlers for requests
 *   Validators (implemented by INSTRUCTION_Validator and XCFValidator) -- these objects are used to validate
 *   	request parameters.
 *   Setters (implemented by INSTRUCTION_Setter and XCFSetter) -- these objects are used to transform request
 *   	parameter values to native objects in the context.
 *   Parameter Processor (implemented by INSTRUCTION_ParameterProcessor) -- these objects act as containers for
 *      validator and setter objects.  There is typically one of these for each request parameter processed.
 *   Composite (implemented by INSTRUCTION_Composite) -- these objects act as containers for other processing instructions.
 *   	There is typcially one of these object bound to a module operation.  This object will typically contain one or more
 *   	child insructions.
